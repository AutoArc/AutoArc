"The DSL you just generated is incorrect, Please regenerate: "{}"
only DSL. The wrong message is: {}
Please regenerate the DSL using these guidelines and correct the identified errors,and Add ";" at the end of the generated DSL,only DSL.


The DSL generated correctly before “--> loc” does not need to change,save it. “--> loc” in the wrong message indicates where the problems might have occurred. Please follow these steps to correct the following part DSL:

1. **Consistency Check**: Ensure that the corrected DSL maintains consistency with the natural language input and that no information is lost during conversion.

2. **Syntax Correction**: Verify that the DSL symbols meet the syntax requirements. Ensure the natural language is fully transformed into DSL, with correct scope and range.
    - Example: For "in myapp" , convert it to "(packagename "myapp")".
    - Example: For "that implement myapp", convert it to "(implementation "myapp")".
    - Example: For "that match myapp", convert it to "(match "myapp")".

3. **Keyword Verification**: Ensure that the generated keywords meet the grammar requirements and are within the provided range.
    - Example: If the natural language mentions "class", the corresponding DSL keyword should be "class".

4. **Detailed Error Review**: Address specific syntax errors mentioned in the DSL syntax check message. For instance, if the message indicates a expected thing, correct it accordingly.
    - Example of correction:  ensure the generated DSL includes the correct scope range or the correct (...), [...] matched.

Please regenerate the DSL using these guidelines and correct the identified errors,and Add ";" at the end of the generated DSL,only DSL.
